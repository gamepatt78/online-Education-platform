            <ul>
                <li>Go to the <strong>Assignments</strong> section and click "Create Assignment" or edit an existing one.</li>
                <li>Find the <strong>Due Date</strong> field and select the deadline date and time for submission.</li>
                <li>Communicate the deadline clearly in the assignment description.</li>
                <li>Students will see the deadline on their dashboard and receive reminders.</li>
                <li>You can extend or modify deadlines by editing the assignment before the due date.</li>
                <li>After the deadline passes, submissions may be marked as late or closed, based on your settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tip: Setting clear deadlines helps students manage their time and stay organized.</p>
